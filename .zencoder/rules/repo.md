## Summary
This repository appears to be set up for an Odoo hackathon event scheduled for October 4, 2025. The project is in its initial stages with minimal content currently available.

## Structure
The repository currently contains only a README.md file at the root level. No additional directories or source files have been created yet.

## Repository Status
This repository appears to be newly initialized with:
- A basic README.md file
- Git version control setup
- No specific programming language files or configurations detected

## Next Steps
To develop this project further, consider:
1. Adding Odoo module directories following standard structure:
   - models/
   - views/
   - security/
   - static/
   - data/
   - __init__.py
   - __manifest__.py

2. Setting up development environment:
   - requirements.txt for Python dependencies
   - Docker configuration for containerized development
   - Documentation for setup and contribution guidelines

3. Implementing testing framework:
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Test data fixtures

## Odoo Development Resources
For Odoo development, typical requirements include:
- Python 3.7+
- PostgreSQL database
- Odoo framework (community or enterprise edition)
- Development dependencies like linting tools and test frameworks

Standard Odoo module structure follows a specific pattern for models, views, and business logic organization that should be implemented as the project develops.
