## 🧪 Full Testing Workflow

### Test 1: Create an Expense (via Postman)

First, login as the employee to get their token:

**POST** `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login`
```json
{
  "email": "jane.employee@company.com",
  "password": "employee123456"
}
```

Copy the token from the response.

Now create an expense:

**POST** `http://localhost:5000/api/expenses`

**Headers**:
- `Authorization`: `Bearer <paste_employee_token_here>`
- `Content-Type`: `application/json`

**Body**:
```json
{
  "title": "Office Supplies Purchase",
  "amount": 150.50,
  "category": "Office Supplies",
  "description": "Purchased pens, papers, and folders for the office",
  "date": "2025-01-15"
}
```

Create a few more expenses with different categories:

```json
{
  "title": "Client Lunch Meeting",
  "amount": 85.00,
  "category": "Meals",
  "description": "Lunch with potential client at downtown restaurant",
