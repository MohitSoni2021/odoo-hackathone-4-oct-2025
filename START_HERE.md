## 🎯 Your Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Create Admin User (5 minutes)

1. **Open Postman** (or any API client)

2. **Import the Postman Collection:**
   - File: `Expense_Management_API.postman_collection.json`
   - Or manually create requests using the guide below

3. **Create Your First Admin:**
   ```
   POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/create-admin
   
   Body (JSON):
   {
     "firstName": "Your Name",
     "lastName": "Last Name",
     "email": "admin@yourcompany.com",
     "password": "admin123456",
     "country": "United States",
     "companyName": "Your Company Name"
   }
   ```

4. **Save the Token** from the response - you'll need it!

### Step 2: Test the API (10 minutes)

Test these key endpoints:

1. **Login**
   ```
   POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
   Body: { "email": "admin@yourcompany.com", "password": "admin123456" }
   ```

2. **Get Current User**
   ```
   GET http://localhost:5000/api/auth/me
   Header: Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
   ```

3. **Create a Manager**
   ```
   POST http://localhost:5000/api/users
   Header: Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
   Body: {
     "firstName": "John",
     "lastName": "Manager",
     "email": "manager@company.com",
     "password": "manager123456",
     "role": "manager",
     "country": "United States"
   }
   ```

4. **Get All Users**
   ```
   GET http://localhost:5000/api/users
