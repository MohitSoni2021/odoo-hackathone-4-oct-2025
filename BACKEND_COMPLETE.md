## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot connect to MongoDB"
**Solution:** Check your MONGODB_URI in .env file

### Issue: "User already exists"
**Solution:** Use a different email or delete the existing user from database

### Issue: "Unauthorized"
**Solution:** Make sure you're including the Bearer token in Authorization header

### Issue: "Cannot find module"
**Solution:** Run `npm install` in backend directory

---

## 📊 Database Indexes (Optimized for Performance)

```javascript
// Users
- email (unique)
- company + role
- manager

// Expenses
- submittedBy + status
- company + status
- date (descending)

// Notifications
- recipient + isRead
- createdAt (descending)
```
